Minerskurk (goblin) description:
"Deep in the caverns of the Square, where the glow of radioactive minerals is the only light, live the Minerskurk. Contact with the radioactive mineral has corrupted thseir nature, making this race fearsome and ambitious. From the burrows of their giant rats, they await their opportunity to conquer the entire Square."



1. Dwarves can build "diggy holes" in their own land, it costs 3 stars.
2. "Diggy holes" give +1 population and stops movement (as algae does but over land).

3. Once per city you can build a "factory" (it cost 7 stars). 
4. "Factories" give +1 star for every "diggy hole" around.
5. If you look closely, diggy holes + factories work similar to "algae + clathurs" (cymanti) but in dry soil.

6. As diggy holes stop movement, dwarves use tunnels instead of roads (every tunnel cost 5 star). Tunnels can be placed even over mountains, but only in your own kingdom.
7. A tunnel communicates with any other tunnel 3 tiles away, as they were next each other. Also, tunnels create connections between cities as mycelium does. 

8. "Diggy holes" would be the initial tech of this tribe, along with chopping trees tech. It will replace "lumber hut" tech. 

9. "Mathematics" will be replaced by "exploding" tech that includes:
--> "Factories" tech.
--> "Dynamiter" warrior. [dash, splash // attack 2, defense 1, movement 1, range 2, cost 5, HP 10]

10. "Archery" will be replaced by "entrechment" tech that includes:
--> "Ranger" warrior [fortify // attack 2, defense 1, movement 1, range 3, cost 5, HP 10]
--> "Hole defense" tech.

11. "Spiritualism" will include "ancestor" tech. It allows to build 1 giant statue per city that produces 3 population and cost 30 stars (it is worth 200 points).

12. So we have a no forestry tribe, with its own resource-economy (holes), an unique terrain-movement system and a lot of thematic issues. All this changes will produce a new way to play with very interesting problems-solutions.

13. Other new units:
--> "wagoner" warrior replaces "defender". [dash, fortify // attack 1, defense 3, movement 2, range 1, cost 5, HP 20]
-->  "ax thrower" replaces "knight". [dash, fortify, persist // attack 3, defense 2, movement 3, range 2, cost 8, HP 10]
-->  "troll golem" giant replaces "superunit". [stomp, fortify, float // attack 4, defense 3, movement 1, range 1, HP 30]

14. I wouldn't introduce any other tech or unit in the other branches of the tech tree. This is enought.
